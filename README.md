Conclusion After analysing this Tour and Travel Data:
1.	Being a frequent flyer and having high income are the two significant features where Churn exceeds non-churn. Intuitively, this makes sense. Someone with more money and who flyâ€™s a lot is more likely to experiment with different travel companies if they have to travel a lot.
2.	Age 27 and 28 churn more than any other age group
3.	The highest customer churn has also seen in the situation where customer have low and middle income. This may give us an idea of the needs of the customers, and you can utilise the insights to work on how to lower your pricing without affecting your revenue, which you can then offer to your customers, which can prevent the customer churn.
4.	The largest customer churn has been observed when a consumer has not made a hotel reservation. This may be due to a number of factors, including expensive hotel rates and longer waiting lists for reservations, both of which have a substantial impact on why people don't book hotels.
5.	More the Service Opted by Customer has lowered the rate of Churning
6.	Customer whose account synched with social media has lower number of churning rates
